# Financial Data Analysis
This project performs financial data analysis using Python, focusing on key stocks in the market. The analysis includes downloading historical stock prices, calculating daily returns, visualizing trends, and implementing a basic recommender system based on correlation.

# Features

# Data Loading and Exploration:

Utilizes the yfinance library to download historical stock prices for selected tickers.
Displays the first few rows of the dataset to provide a quick overview.
Data Analysis:

Calculates daily returns for each stock in the dataset.
Provides basic statistics of daily returns, offering insights into the volatility of each stock.
# Recommender System:

Measures the correlation between the daily returns of different stocks.
Recommends top correlated stocks for a given stock.

# Visualization:

Plots daily returns for selected stocks to visually inspect trends.
Creates a heatmap to represent the correlation matrix.
Getting Started
Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Install required Python packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Running the Code:

Execute the main script: python financial_data_analysis.py.

# Configuration:

Adjust the list of stock tickers in the script according to your preferences.

# Usage Examples
Load and Visualize Data
python
Copy code
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical stock prices
stock_data = yf.download(['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL'], start='2022-01-01', end='2023-01-01')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(stock_data.head())
Calculate Daily Returns
python
Copy code
# Calculate daily returns
daily_returns = stock_data['Adj Close'].pct_change()

# Display basic statistics of daily returns
print(daily_returns.describe())
Visualize Correlation
python
Copy code
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Calculate correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = daily_returns.corr()

# Plot correlation matrix as a heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', linewidths=.5)
plt.title('Correlation Matrix of Daily Returns')
plt.show()
